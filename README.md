# Banking_Application
My First project in java to improve my programing skills.

## This simple, beginner-friendly simple banking application that acts as a checking account. It utilizes print statements, if/else statements, strings, ints, methods, loops, and more. Using these techniques, the bank program created allows the user to perform multiple different functions:

    Check your balance
    Make a deposit
    Make a withdrawal
    View the previous transaction
    Calculate Interest
    Exit the application
