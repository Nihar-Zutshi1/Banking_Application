## Banking_Application
My First project in java to improve my programing skills.

# What is in this project?
This simple, beginner-friendly simple banking application that acts as a checking account. It utilizes print statements, if/else statements, strings, ints, methods, loops, and more. Using these techniques, the bank program created allows the user to perform multiple different functions:

   1) Check your balance
   2) Make a deposit
   3) Make a withdrawal
   4) View the previous transaction
   5) Calculate Interest
   6) Exit the application
